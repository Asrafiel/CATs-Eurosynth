<h2>Modulove Appendix</h2>
This is a PCB version of the awesome HAGIWO Clock SYNC LFO.
It was published on Github by [mzuelch](https://github.com/mzuelch/ "mzuelch") and we (modulove) put together the design & kits in our lab.

The module is a Arduino-based LFO and can be clocked / synced via the trigger input and offers internal modulation to create complex waveforms.
It can be modified / reprogrammed easily with the Arduino IDE.

It offers six waveforms and the following hardware features:

- Panel Design by [bkrsmdesign](https://www.instagram.com/bkrsmdesign/ "Sasha Kruse")
- Knob1: Amplifier control. Set the output voltage
- Knob2: Phase control. Set the phase from 0-360Â°
- Knob3: Waveform control. Select the waveform type.
- Knob4: Internal modulation, creating complex waveforms.
- CLK in: Clock IN.
- OUTPUT Voltage 0/+10V
- Skiff friendly & 6P
- 50 mA draw

<h1>Changes mzuelch made to the original design</h1>
<ul>
	<li>PWM -> Analog Conversion by active Steiner LPF (fg=500Hz) instead of passive RC network</li>
	<li>Unipolar output changed from 0/+5V to 0/+10V</li>
	<li>Additional bipolar output +/-10V</li>
	<li>Additional inverted bipolar output +/-10V</li>
</ul>


DIY Info:

Building the Module is simple and suited for beginners. The Kit comes with SMD parts already soldered.
