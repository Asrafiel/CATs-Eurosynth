# CATs Eurosynth
This is my MIT licensed repository for my analog synth eurorack compatible modules
<h1>Slim Line</h1>
Slim Modules to cope with the ever increasing lamentations from my bandmates and wife.

<h1>MFOS Clones</h1>
The basic electronic design was made by <a href="http://musicfromouterspace.com/">Music From Outer Space</a>.
The remodelling in KiCAD, slight adaptation, PCB layout and frontpanel designs are based on my own faults
RIP Ray Wilson
<h1>YuSynth Clones</h1>
The basic electronic design was made by <a href="https://yusynth.net">YuSynth</a>.
The remodelling in KiCAD, slight adaptation (especially changes to +/-12V), PCB layout and frontpanel designs are based on my own faults.
