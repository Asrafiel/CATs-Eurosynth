<h1>Library settings</h1>
<p>Additional libraries are included by a environmental variable (KI_CUSTOM_SYMBOLS in this case) and as global libraries. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Active: TRUE</li>
	<li>Aliasname: Eurorack_Synth</li>
	<li>Path: $(KI_CUSTOM_SYMBOLS)/CATs_Eurorack_Synth.lib</li>
	<li>Type: Legacy</li>
	<li>Options: empty</li>
	<li>Annotations: as you like it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Aliasnames</h2>

<p>You may remodel the libraries, paths ans aliases according to your own needs of course. BUT: Compatibility with future releases will be lost.</p>
